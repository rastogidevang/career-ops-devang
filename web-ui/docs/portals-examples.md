# portals.yml — ready-to-paste blocks

Drop these into the `tracked_companies:` list of your `career-ops/portals.yml`
to enable scanning against the 6 ATS adapters career-ops-ui supports:
**Greenhouse · Ashby · Lever · Workable · SmartRecruiters · Workday**.

If a slug ever 404s upstream, just remove that one entry — the scanner
skips companies whose API call fails and continues with the rest.

> **v1.14.0 update.** Three new adapters joined the registry (Workable,
> SmartRecruiters, Workday). The blocks below for those three are
> documented examples — verify the slug in each board's URL before
> pasting. Workday is **beta** because each customer hosts on a different
> tenant + site path; the adapter assumes `site=External` when omitted.

## How to find more boards

The detection is dead simple — for any company you suspect uses one of these
ATS systems, try:

```bash
curl -sS "https://boards-api.greenhouse.io/v1/boards/<slug>/jobs" -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n"
curl -sS "https://api.ashbyhq.com/posting-api/job-board/<slug>?includeCompensation=true" -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n"
curl -sS "https://api.lever.co/v0/postings/<slug>" -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n"
```

`200` means there's a board with that slug. `404` means try a different slug.
The slug is usually the company name in lowercase, dash-separated, or the
subdomain of their careers site. Examples:

- `https://boards.greenhouse.io/instacart` → slug `instacart`
- `https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/linear` → slug `linear`
- `https://jobs.lever.co/jetbrains` → slug `jetbrains`

## v1.14.0 — 13 trending boards (assign to your registered ATS)

These companies appeared in user requests; each one's `careers_url` is the
SPA-recognizable form. **Verify the slug before pasting** — companies do
migrate between ATSes. If you hit a 404, drop the entry or update the URL
to whichever ATS the company moved to. The `enabled: false` flag below is
intentional — flip to `true` after you confirm the slug responds.
