/**
 * Workday CXS adapter (v1.14.0 registry contract, BETA).
 *
 * Workday hosts each customer on `<tenant>.wd<N>.myworkdayjobs.com/<site>`.
 * The unauthenticated jobs feed for a given site is at
 *   /wday/cxs/<tenant>/<site>/jobs
 *
 * Detection from `careers_url`:
 *   https://<tenant>.wd5.myworkdayjobs.com/en-US/External
 *   →  tenant=<tenant>, wdN=wd5, site=External
 *   →  endpoint:  https://<tenant>.wd5.myworkdayjobs.com/wday/cxs/<tenant>/External/jobs
 *
 * If the customer's site lives behind a CAPTCHA or non-standard path,
 * the adapter throws — we recommend falling back to `/career-ops scan`
 * (parent CLI, drives a real browser via Playwright).
